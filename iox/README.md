# iox

English | [中文](https://github.com/EddieIvan01/iox/tree/master/docs/README_CN.md)

Tool for port forward & intranet proxy, just like `lcx`/`ew`, but better

# Why write?

`lcx` and `ew` are awesome, but can be improved.

When I first used them, I can't remember these complicated parameters for a long time, such as `tran, slave, rcsocks, sssocks...`. The work mode is clear, why do they design parameters like this(especially `ew`'s `-l -d -e -f -g -h`)

Besides, I think the net programming logic could be optimized. 

For example, while running `lcx -listen 8888 9999` command, client must connect to `:8888` first, then `:9999`, in `iox`, there's no limit to the order in two ports. And while running `lcx -slave 1.1.1.1 8888 1.1.1.1 9999` command, `lcx` will connect two hosts serially, but it's more efficient to connect in concurrent, as `iox` does.

What's more, `iox` provides traffic encryption feature (it's useful when there is a IDS on target). Actually, you can use `iox` as a simple ShadowSocks. 

And `iox` also provides UDP traffic forward.

Of course, because `iox` is written in Go, the static-link-program is a little large, raw program is 2.2MB (800KB after UPX compression)

# Features

+ Traffic encryption (optional)
+ Humanized CLI option
+ Logic optimization
+ UDP traffic forward
+ TCP multiplexing in reverse proxy mode

# Usage

You can see, all params are uniform. `-l/--local` means listen on a local port; `-r/--remote` means connect to remote host

**Note: after v0.4, `-l/--local` could specify which IP to listen on. If only ports are specified, the default is `0.0.0.0:PORT`** 

```
-l 127.0.0.1:9999      -l *127.0.0.1:9999      # 127.0.0.1:9999
-l 9999                -l *9999                # 0.0.0.0:9999

`-l :9999` is also OK, but it's not recommended. Because `-l *:9999`(listen on 0.0.0.0:9999 with encryption) is ambiguous
```

## Working mode

### fwd

Listen on `0.0.0.0:8888` and `0.0.0.0:9999`, forward traffic between 2 connections

```
./iox fwd -l 8888 -l 9999
```

Listen on `0.0.0.0:8888`, forward traffic to `1.1.1.1:9999`

```
./iox fwd -l 8888 -r 1.1.1.1:9999
```

Connect `1.1.1.1:8888` and `1.1.1.1:9999`, forward between 2 connection

```
./iox fwd -r 1.1.1.1:8888 -r 1.1.1.1:9999
```

### proxy

Start Socks5 server on `0.0.0.0:1080`

```
./iox proxy -l 1080
```

Start Socks5 server on be-controlled host, then forward to internet VPS

VPS forward `0.0.0.0:9999` to `0.0.0.0:1080`

You must use in a pair, because it contains a simple protocol to control connecting back

```
./iox proxy -r 1.1.1.1:9999
./iox proxy -l 9999 -l 1080       // notice, the two port are in order


for ew:
./ew -s rcsocks -l 1080 -e 9999
./ew -s rssocks -d 1.1.1.1 -e 9999
```

Then connect intranet host

```
# proxychains.conf
# socks5://1.1.1.1:1080

$ proxychains rdesktop 192.168.0.100:3389
```

***

## Enable encryption

For example, we forward 3389 port in the intranet to our VPS

```
// be-controller host
./iox fwd -r 192.168.0.100:3389 -r *1.1.1.1:8888 -k 656565


// our VPS
./iox fwd -l *8888 -l 33890 -k 656565
```

It's easy to understand: traffic between be-controlled host and our VPS:8888 will be encrypted, the pre-shared secret key is 'AAA', `iox` will use it to generate seed key and nonce **(Normally, nonce shouldn't be reused. But consider that iox's encryption is only for bypassing IDS, in order not to allocate extra space, the TCP stream encryption will reuse the nonce)**, then encrypt with Xchacha20 (replace AES-CTR with Xchacha20 in v0.3 version)

So, the `*` should be used in pairs

```
./iox fwd -l 1000 -r *127.0.0.1:1001 -k 000102
./iox fwd -l *1001 -r *127.0.0.1:1002 -k 000102
./iox fwd -l *1002 -r *127.0.0.1:1003 -k 000102
./iox proxy -l *1003 -k 000102


$ curl google.com -x socks5://127.0.0.1:1000
```

Using `iox` as a simple ShadowSocks 

```
// ssserver
./iox proxy -l *9999 -k 000102


// sslocal
./iox fwd -l 1080 -r *VPS:9999 -k 000102
```

## UDP forward

Only need to add CLI option `-u`

```
./iox fwd -l 53 -r *127.0.0.1:8888 -k 000102 -u
./iox fwd -l *8888 -l *9999 -k 000102 -u
./iox fwd -r *127.0.0.1:9999 -r 8.8.8.8:53 -k 000102 -u
```

**NOTICE: When you make a multistage connection, the `Remote2Remote-UDP-mode` must be started last, which is the No.3 command in above example**

UDP forwarding may have behavior that is not as you expected. Actually, on GitHub now, there are only examples of forwarding a local listener to a remote host, so I can only implement them with my understanding

You can find why in the source code. If you have any ideas, PR / issue are welcomed
